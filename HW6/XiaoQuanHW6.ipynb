All of these factors can contribute to mis-classification. `\n",

First, the way audio data is represented in the classifier (Summary statistics of summary statics) might obfuscate certain important information. Second, The wind instruments have a lot of harmonic contents that are similar. They also have a considerable amount of reverb in the mix. Lastly, in comparason to piano samples, which contains a large variety of playing styles and frequency ranges, other information might be confused with instrument classification, such as musical patterns etc.`\n",

Lastly, when it comes to lower notes, they resemble a similar timbre. These factors could be a reason for how the classifier can get them wrong.`"
